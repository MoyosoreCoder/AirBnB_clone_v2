0x02. AirBnB clone - MySQL

0. Fork me if you can!
In the industry, you will work on an existing codebase 90% of the time. Your first thoughts upon looking at it might include:

“Who did this code?”
“How it works?”
“Where are unittests?”
“Where is this?”
“Why did they do that like this?”
“I don’t understand anything.”
“… I will refactor everything…”
But the worst thing you could possibly do is to redo everything. Please don’t do that! Note: the existing codebase might be perfect, or it might have errors. Don’t always trust the existing codebase!

For this project you will fork this codebase:

update the repository name to AirBnB_clone_v2
update the README.md with your information but don’t delete the initial authors
If you are the owner of this repository, please create a new repository named AirBnB_clone_v2 with the same content of AirBnB_clone
